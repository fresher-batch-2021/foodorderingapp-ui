        In the United States, the first restaurant food delivery service in the world began in 1995 with World Wide Waiter and still operates today as Waiter.com. The top three restaurant food delivery services are DoorDash,GrubHub, and Uber Eats, which together
        account for some 80 percent of the sector's revenue. The remainder is accounted for by smaller services. Retail food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer.
        An order is typically made either through a restaurant or grocer's website or mobile app, or through a food ordering company. The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes
        or bags. The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters. Recently, we have also seen the use of autonomous vehicles by companies like
        Starship Technologies, currently available in the USA and the UK to complete deliveries. </p>

        Customers can, depending on the delivery company, choose to pay online or in person, with cash or card. A flat rate delivery fee is often charged with what the customer has bought. Sometimes no delivery fees are charged depending upon the situation. Tips
        are often customary for food delivery service. Contactless delivery may also be an option. Meal delivery orders are typically on demand, intended to be eaten right away, and include hot, already-prepared food. While some service providers offer
        subscription services, ordering for delivery usually involves contacting a local restaurant or chain by telephone or online. Online ordering is available in many countries, where some stores offer online menus and ordering. Since 1995, companies
        such as Waiter.com have their own interfaces where customers order food from nearby restaurants that have partnered with the service. Meal delivery requires special technology and care, since the food items are already cooked and prepared, and
        can be easily damaged if dropped, tilted, or left out for long periods of time. Hotbags are often used to keep food warm. They are thermal bags, typically made of vinyl, nylon, or Cordura, that passively retain heat. </p>

        In South America, food delivery services include Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub, DiDi, the dominant ride-hailing company in China, and Rappi, based in Colombia. Both Didi and Rappi are funded by SoftBank, the Japanese investment fund that is also a major
        investor in Uber. In a 2019 market study of restaurant delivery services, the global market for online-ordered prepared food delivery was estimated at $94 billion and is estimated to grow at just over 9 percent a year, reaching $134.5 billion
        in 2023. The study defined the market as 1)"meals ordered online which are directly delivered by the restaurant, no matter if ordered via a platform or a restaurant website online meal orders and deliveries "both carried out by a platform" ."online
        orders that are picked up in the restaurant" by the customer. It does not include phone orders.
